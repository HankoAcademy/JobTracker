## What you'll be building
Job Tracker is an app to manage and track the status of your job applications. 

With Job Tracker, the long list of upcoming, in progress, or completed applications can be better managed and tracked, allowing less time looking through old emails from recruiters and more time preparing for interviews. 

All applications entered will stay saved in the app, even if you close out of the app. There's also the ability to favorite certain application entries so you can keep an eye on your favorite applications.
